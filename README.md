Project Overview:
A machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using medical and lifestyle data. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation, providing insights into patient risk factors.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling to prepare clean datasets.

Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features to improve model performance.

Model Building: Implemented Logistic Regression, KNN, GaussianNB, Decision Tree, SVM

Model Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model reliability.

Visualization: Explored correlations and feature importance with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Tech Stack:
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Jupyter Notebook

Out of all the models, we will use KNN because of the corresponding accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall.
